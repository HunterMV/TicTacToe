# TicTacToe
This is a simple Unity project built by following a Unity article that can be found [here](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/creating-a-tic-tac-toe-game-using-only-ui-components#5c7f8528edbc2a002053b4c4). This was done to gain more knowledge of Unity UI tools as the whole project was build using only UI objects. This was a useful exercise and helped me to better understand the use of the UI tools in Unity, it also helped me to understand how to create cleaner code. You can try the game [here](https://huntermv.github.io/TicTacToe/TicTacToeWeb/).
